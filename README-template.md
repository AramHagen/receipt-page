## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (CSS variables)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass (SCSS)

### What I learned
I learned how to use the `&` symbol to import two fonts in my HTML `(family=Outfit:wght@100..900&family=Young+Serif)`. I also learned that the `<link>` approach is faster and more efficient, while using `@import` in CSS introduces delays and additional requests.

- `@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@100..900&family=Young+Serif&display=swap')`; in the CSS file.
- Adding `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@100..900&family=Young+Serif&display=swap" />` to the `<head>` tag."
